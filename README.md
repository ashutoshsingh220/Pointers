# Pointers

## Aim:
To study and implement C++ pointers basics.

## Software used:
visual studio code

## Theory:
A pointer in C++ is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Pointers are used for dynamic memory allocation, arrays, and functions.

## Algorithm:
Displaying Pointer Information:

-Start.

-Declare an integer variable var and initialize it to 10.

-Declare an integer pointer ptr.

-Assign the address of var to ptr using the address-of operator &.

-Display the value of var.

-Display the address of var.

-Display the value stored in ptr (which is the address of var).

-Display the value pointed to by ptr using the dereference operator .

-End.
